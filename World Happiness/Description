  This project was for an undergraduate data science class Data 219: Foundations of Data Science. The class was focused on machine learning, how best to understand data for machine learning. For this project I was tasked with selecting a large data set, clean the data using machine learning and then develop some conclusions from the data using a model developed from amchine learning. 

  The data set I chose for the project was the World Happiness Report ranging from 2007 to 2019. It contained almost two thousand entries for countries throughout those years, and it measured nine components of those countries. From that data set I cleaned the inconsistant data, dropped missing years or values, and categorized the different countries into different regions to make data analysis easier.
