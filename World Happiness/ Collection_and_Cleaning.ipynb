In order to do this I wanted to collect data from across the world across time to see how different places were impacted by different factors. In working to solve this question we can do better work to improve peoples lives in meaningful ways. It is folly to expect that a solution in one place of the world would work across the globe. In attempting to answer the question of world happiness, hopefully we can better understand what we can do to help."

The difference between the two is that the 2021 dataset was much cleaner and only focused on one year, whereas the secondary set was panel data across multiple years. I will be using the secondary dataset because having more data points provides more evidence and allows for more confidence in the conclusions that arise from said data."
