  This folder contains some of the projects I completed while I was taking Modeling and Simulation data science course. The main models I worked on and learned about where System Dynamics model and Agent Based modeling. The work on system dynamics can be found in the modeling folder and the agent based modeling in the simulations. This course was very instructive in how I understand data, how models work, and how we can better understand the results from data analysis.
