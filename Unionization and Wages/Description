     This folder contains the results of the final project of my econometerics class. i was tasked with collecting, cleaning, and analyzing a set of data and presenting the process and the results to the rest of my class. I decided to look at the relationship between unions and wage rates becuase I believe that labor and its relationship with the rest of capitalism can communicate a lot about the state of the economy. 
     In this folder you will see the data, both the raw data, and the cleaned and processed data that I used to conduct analysis. Addtionally you find the code I wrote to analyze the cleaned data and the results from there. Additionally, you will find the final report and the poster that was made to present the written report to my class.
