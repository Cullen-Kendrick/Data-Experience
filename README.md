# Data-Experience
I am Cullen Kendrick and I am recent graduate of the University of Mary Washington. I graduated with a degree in Economics and Philosophy (with departmental honors), and a minor in data science. 

This repository serves as a portfolio of my data analysis experience. Each project folder contains: 
- A detailed description of the dataset and its context 
- The analytical methodology and approach used
- Complete source code for analysis and modeling 
- Data visualizations and key findings

My academic background combines quantitative economic analysis with philosophical critical thinking, allowing me to approach data problems with both technical precision and conceptual depth. 
Feel free to explore my projects and reach out with any questions or opportunities for collaboration.
