This folder contains the work done for a final research project for the final econometrics class. I wanted to look into how the United States handled COVID-19 relief compared to other countries. In order to do that I wanted to create a "difference in difference" model with mutliple different countries. I gathered the data from the Federal Reserve detailing many economic factors such as GDP per capitia, Employment, and CPI. 
From that point, I hand cleaned the data I gathered. I then used Stata to construct the model and analyize the results. To find the cleaned data look in the "Data Cleaned" file in this folder. To find my Stata code and model construction look in the "USAID Stata Data". And to find my full report download the file "USAID Research Paper". 
If you don't want to download the file here is the final results from my paper. 

"The results of the regression point to the fact that there is high likelihood that the aid the United State Government provided during the pandemic was highly helpful for individuals. The incredible significance and large coefficient suggest that people were able to consume much more after the child tax credit. And while consumption isnâ€™t a one-to-one measure for complete wellbeing, it still indicates a level of spending is increasing. And when households and spend more, that means they have the ability to engage more with the economy. It allows for markets to grow and firms benefit greatly. The fact that the change of the how the child tax credit functioned allows for such a significant benefit to consumption shows two things. 
	The first is that it shows the extent of need for such a change in the United States economy. The tax credit was augmented to address the economic stress that many households were experiencing. In a year that saw many people lose their jobs, granting aid that effectively increased their income was hugely beneficial. Additionally, because of how the tax credit is structured, scaled as progressive, meant that the households that needed the money the most were able to gain the most from the tax credit. 
	The second thing these results tell us is that directed and careful aid to individuals or households is extremely effective. This result is backed by previous research that was cited earlier in the paper. When government aid is directed at individual households and consumers and when it is careful, provided to those who need it most, the benefit to the economy and individual is enormous. Looking at the aid now it clear that its use cannot be overstated, and while there is rationale for why the extended tax credit was only temporary to soft the difficulties of the pandemic, it would not be a terrible idea for a similar extension to be developed for a long-term form of government aid."
