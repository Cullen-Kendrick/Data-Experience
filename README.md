# Data-Experience
A place to view some of the work I've done in Data Analytics and Data Science

I am Cullen Kendrick and I am recent graduate of the University of Mary Washington. I graduated with a degree in Economics with departmental honors, and a minor in data science. 

The files in this respository are an overview of my experience with data in the past. Each folder will contain a description of what the data was, how I worked on it, and the context in which it was created. Additonally, the files will contain the code used in the project and any visualization that was created for the project.
